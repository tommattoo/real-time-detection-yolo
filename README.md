 # YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection

This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model by Ultralytics. The program captures live video from the webcam and identifies objects in real time with high accuracy and speed. This is ideal for applications such as security systems, smart surveillance, and interactive AI-based applications.
